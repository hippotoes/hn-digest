## User Prompt
read all docs and code to make sure your comfirmation is right. If not show me the difference.

## Agent Action
1. Performed a source-code audit of `queue.ts` and `inference.ts`.
2. Verified the line-by-line execution order of the Map-Reduce pipeline.
3. Confirmed that `generateAnalysis` uses raw text and precedes the embedding call.
4. Updated `docs/QA_HISTORY.md` with the audit proof.

## Response Summary
Provided formal proof from the codebase that DeepSeek reasoning is independent of and prior to the embedding step. Verified that the current "Durable Synthesis" logic correctly protects analysis results.
