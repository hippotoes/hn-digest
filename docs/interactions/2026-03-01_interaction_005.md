## User Prompt
in the current system, if the embedding fails, does it sill use raw text to do the deepseek reasoning?

## Agent Action
1. Clarified the pipeline topology: Scraper -> DeepSeek -> Embedding.
2. Confirmed that DeepSeek reasoning is independent of embedding success.
3. Updated `docs/QA_HISTORY.md` with the decoupling rationale.

## Response Summary
Explained that DeepSeek always uses raw text for reasoning, as the embedding is a post-synthesis indexing step. Failure of the latter does not affect the former.
