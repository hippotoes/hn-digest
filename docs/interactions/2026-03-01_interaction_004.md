## User Prompt
If the embedding failed, can we feed raw text to deepseek?

## Agent Action
1. Clarified the distinction between **Generative Analysis** (already using raw text) and **Vector Embeddings** (mathematical requirement for search).
2. Proposed a "Durable Synthesis" strategy to prevent loss of DeepSeek results during embedding failures.
3. Updated `docs/QA_HISTORY.md` with the Graceful Degradation rationale.

## Response Summary
Explained that raw text cannot substitute for vectors in a DB, but we can refactor the pipeline to ensure stories are saved even if embedding fails, preserving expensive AI synthesis.
