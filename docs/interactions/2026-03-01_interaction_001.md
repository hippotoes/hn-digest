# Interaction Log - 2026-03-01T14:30:00Z

## User Prompt
Put the following rule into the GEMINI.md, the wording could be changed to a more pro way:
1. whenever I ask a why question, log the question, the answer and the date to a QA history md file, with good versioning of it.
2. log every prompt I asked and your response in a structured way so I could refer it anytime.

## Agent Action
1. Updated `GEMINI.md` with Section 6: "Knowledge Management & Auditability".
2. Defined professional mandates for "Architectural Rationale Persistence" and "Structured Interaction Ledger".
3. Initialized `docs/QA_HISTORY.md` with the first technical justification (Gemini vs. DeepSeek substitution).
4. Created `docs/interactions/` for chronological session logging.

## Response Summary
Rules integrated into foundational mandates. Technical rationale for Gemini usage persisted to `docs/QA_HISTORY.md`. High-fidelity logging initialized.
